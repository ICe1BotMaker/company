# Companyâ„¢
I created the 2d version of the **Lethal Company**.

### Moons
- experimentation
- company

### Store
- shovel
- flashlight

### Rules
The rules of the game are no different.

- Use the command to move the ship to the planet.
- After landing, enter the main gate.
- Collect all the waste hardware as much as possible, and take off.
- If there are 0 days left after 3 days, land at the company and fill the quota with waste hardware collected.

### Functions
- Create seed-specific maps using labyrinth generation algorithms
- Managing the state of the game
- Use items (steel shovels, flashlights, keys, etc.)
- Repeated Patterned AI Monster (Under development)
